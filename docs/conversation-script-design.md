# Script Design

When building a conversational flow, it is best to start from a script of what you expect your users to say and what the system will say in return. This can be as basic as denoting User/System before each dialog in a Word Document:

* User: Hey, Voicebot - what time is it?
* System: It’s currently 11am.

This helps you track the kind of flow and functionality you need by starting from a real conversational place, which helps with a more-engaging conversation as well as potentially needing less revisions later on when you test with users and notice that the conversation doesn’t flow like a real one would. This is because it’s often easier to see the back-and-forth of the conversation in a script than it is inside a flow.

As an added bonus, you can keep your flows shorter and easier to manage if you contain your verbiage in a document separate from the flow itself, rather than housing the verbiage inside the shape of each prompt in the flow. A shorter flow allows you to see your whole conversation at a glance and allows for QA to more quickly and easily move through their work.

There’s much much more to say about writing the voice bot script and for that, our [resources](/docs/conversation-design-resources) have plenty of information for designers and developers alike, from people who’ve been at this for a while and can offer tips and tricks on how to best design for conversational UIs.
